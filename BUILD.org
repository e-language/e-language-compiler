** Build

The program is released as an [[https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/escript_cmd][escript]] file. We build it with [[http://rebar3.org/docs/getting-started/][rebar3]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  rebar3 escriptize
#+END_SRC

You can find the generated file at ~_build/default/bin/ec~.

To install it on Unix, you can simply copy it to some ~bin~ directory in your ~PATH~.

e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo cp _build/default/bin/ec /usr/local/bin/
#+END_SRC
